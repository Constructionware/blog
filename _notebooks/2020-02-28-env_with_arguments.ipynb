    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an old annoyance that, if you use `env` in a bang path to search the script interpreter in the shell's path, you cannot pass any arguments to it. Instead, all the text after the call to `env` is passed as one single argument, and `env` tries to find this as the executable to invoke, which fails of course when arguments are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "`env` is not the culprit here, but the very definition of how a bang path works (quoted from the `bash` manpage):\n",
    "\n",
    "> If  the  program  is a file beginning with ``#!``, the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program.\n",
    "> The shell executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this executable format  themselves.\n",
    "> The  **arguments to the interpreter consist of a *single* optional argument** following the interpreter name on the first line…  *(emphasis mine)*\n",
    "\n",
    "So what env gets to see in its ``argv`` array when you write something like ``#! /usr/bin/env python3 -I -S`` is ``['/usr/bin/env', 'python3 -I -S']``. And there is no ``python3 -I -S`` anywhere to be found that could interpret your script. 😞"

    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The `env` command in coreutils 8.30 solves this (i.e. Debian Buster only so far, Ubuntu Bionic still has 8.28). The relevant change is introducing a split option (``-S``), designed to handle that special case of getting all arguments mushed together into one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we want to pass the ``-I -S`` options to Python on startup. They increase security of a script, by reducing the possible ways an attacker can insert their malicious code into your runtime environment, as you can see from the help text:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "-I     : isolate Python from the user's environment (implies -E and -s)\n",
    "-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)\n",
    "-s     : don't add user site directory to sys.path; also PYTHONNOUSERSITE\n",
    "-S     : don't imply 'import site' on initialization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try the following yourself using `docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/bash python:3-slim-buster`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ cat >>isolated <<'.'\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env -S python3 -I -S\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print('\\n'.join(sys.path))\n",
    ".\n",
    "$ chmod +x isolated\n",
    "$ ./isolated\n",
    "/usr/local/lib/python38.zip\n",
    "/usr/local/lib/python3.8\n",
    "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, the Python path would include both the current working directory (`/` in this case) as well as site packages (`/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we prevented their inclusion as a source of unanticipated code – and you can be a happy cat again. 😻"
